## New Informations for Update:

# 새로 개발된 N_FoxVc에 적용된 기술과 기능에 대한 설명.  
## 새롭게 개발중인 N_FoxVc은 기존 FoxVc의 문제점을 패치하고 있습니다.  
  * 기존에 존재했던 문제점은...  
    > 악성코드 검사후 각 malware별 치료 모듈이 확고하지 않았음.  
    > 백신 엔진이 직접 악성코드를 탐지하는 형태라서 악성코드 분석시, 상당히 시간이 걸림  
    > Anti-Virus 프로젝트 파일 미성숙  
    > 각종 취약점에 대응하는 보안기술 미적용  
    > 정규화되지 않은 소스코드들  
  > malwareDB로부터 나오는 악성코드 패턴을 효율적으로 사용하지 못하는 소스코드  

[!] 이를 보완하여 상당히 확고화된 새로운 백신을 개발하였습니다.  
    아직도 개발중이긴하지만, 미완성인 Test-code가 2017년-10-28일 오후에 업로드 됩니다.

# Warning          
**This scripts are unstable. so i upload various beta scripts after 1.2.9, like 1.2.91, 1.2.92, 1.2.93 ~  
So, You can see the newly modified source code in the "Test Code for Linux ver" folder before the stable FoxVc 1.2.9 version is uploaded.**

  >- The source code has been updated to make Python users more than 2 versions available through grammatical modifications.  
  > The original version uses sys.version_info to scan the installed version of Python on your system and import and use optimized code for each version.  
2. branch version uses Lib2to3 to build python2 versions of FoxVc and python3 versions of FoxVc separately.  


# 4. A new FoxVc is developed!!!  
## The N_FoxVc is built with a structure and methodology that is significantly different from existing FoxVcs!  
1. N_FoxVc is will be uploaded on 2010-10-30  
  >- New Functions are updated!  
  > supporting zip and rar, 7zip, tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, bz files.  
2. Introduced a new type of vaccine engine!
